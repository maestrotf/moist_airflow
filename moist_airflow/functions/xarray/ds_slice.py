    ----------
    ds : xarray.Dataset
        The input dataset which should be sliced.
    variables : str, iterable or None, optional
        These variables are selected within the dataset. If this is None, all

    isel : dict(str, any) or None, optional
        This dictionary is used to slice the dataset with positional indexing.
        If this is None, the dataset is not sliced. Default is None.
    sel : dict(str, any) or None, optional
        This dictionary is used to slice the dataset with value indexing. If
        this is None the dataset is not sliced. Default is None.
